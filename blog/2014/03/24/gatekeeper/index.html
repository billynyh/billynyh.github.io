	<h2 class="title">The Gatekeeper</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently read some articles from Julie Zhuo&rsquo;s, she is a Product design director in Facebook. Although her posts are not about engineering, I still feel connected with most of the topics.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/5c48db173662">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a gatekeeper&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>If you are somebody with an incredible amount of passion for high quality, you may be compelled to become a gatekeeper at some point in your life.</p></blockquote>


<p>I read this article last night, this is interesting because I just had a similar &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; with my team leads last week about the schedule. We were doing things like other (average) startups do, fast development, no test, keep changing, dirty code everywhere. This worked for a new products, but as the usage increases, the required quality of the app should also increase.</p>

<p>I am not only not happy about the way we work, I also feel that I am losing control of my work. I start feeling I will be no longer able to maintain the app&rsquo;s performance, code quality, and even do a accurate time estimation for new tasks. This is a very serious problem as I considered myself the gatekeeper of the project, even I am not the one to make (any) product decision.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are a gatekeeper or find yourself thinking we need a gatekeeper, the thing that is broken or missing is trust. So instead of judging yes or no, good or bad, consider this instead: what could I do to make it so that I have more trust in the people around me?</p></blockquote>


<p>The result of the discussion was that, I asked for a proper scheduling so that I can at least do my job as a developer, and hope this can change the trust thing a little bit.</p>

<h2>Futher reading</h2>

<p>There are more articles from Julie&rsquo;s <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass">medium</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/d0aa3b8af9b7">&ldquo;Why Designers Leave&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Every person who works in a creative field has an aspiration for her work, a yearning for that ideal plane which is the culmination of her taste.</p><p>When an environment fails, over and over and over again, to provide her with a means to follow her internal compass, then she will leave.</p><p>If you are in a position to influence that kind of environment, take heed. Lay the foundations for a space that nurtures, that yields the kind of work the best creative people can be proud of.</p></blockquote>


<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/bcddf7c85553">&ldquo;Quality is not a tradeoff&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Quality is a bar, not a tradeoff.</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>It just doesn’t work like that.</p><p>Why? Because to create high-quality work, there has to be a minimum acceptable bar. And high-quality creators cannot trade off below that bar. They simply can’t.</p></blockquote>
