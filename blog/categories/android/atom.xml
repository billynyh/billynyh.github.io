    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use messaging app everyday, whatsapp, Facebook messenger, gtalk, web and mobile. The UI of different apps looks natural to me and never tried to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the design of it.</p>

<p>Recently I am working on a messaging UI with a screenshot designer gave me. When I try to imagine how will this design looks like with real chat usage, I am sure there are lots of details not included in the design so I take a deeper look of the messaging app I used everyday.</p>

<p>When you received a message, you usually can see sender information (name / avatar), message content, and sent time. And for the message you send, you may also see deliver status (sent/fail/received/read), retry when fail.</p>

<p>Here are some elements besdies those basic thing.</p>

<h2>Date header</h2>

<p>To avoid displaying the date in every message, a common handling is to have a &ldquo;Date header&rdquo; to divide the messages, and whatsapp also added a sticky header for the date.</p>

<p><a rel="gallery-date" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-2.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-2.jpg"/>
</a>
<a rel="gallery-date" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-3.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-3.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<h2>1-to-1 message VS group chat</h2>

<p>In whatsapp 1-to-1, it only shows the name in action bar and does not include it in the content, it totally makes sense because you know who you are talking to when you are in that page. And for group chat, as more then one people you are talking to but the incoming messages are all aligned left, it is necessary to have the name before each message.</p>

<p>Facebook messenger also has similar logic of adding name but it is outside the bubble.</p>

<p></p>
<a rel="gallery-chat" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-0.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-0.jpg"/>
</a>
<a rel="gallery-chat" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-6.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-6.jpg"/>
</a>
</p></p>

<h2>Message grouping</h2>

<p>Most messaging app styled the messages with talk bubbles, it is interesting to see that some of them are not simply a bubble.</p>

<p>
<a rel="gallery-grouping" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-5.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-5.jpg"/>
</a>
<a rel="gallery-grouping" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-3.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-3.jpg"/>
</a>
<a rel="gallery-grouping" href="/images/posts/20140803/b-1.jpg" class="fancybox">
<img src="/images/posts/20140803/c-1.jpg"/>
</a>
</p>


<p>For Facebook messenger, I found that when continuous messages from same person is grouped, avatar is only showed once, in both 1-to-1 or group message. However, sometimes messages are not grouped, I guess it only groups messages within a short time.</p>

<p>For whatsapp, it groups continuous messages to one single bubble, my first reaction is it would be fun to write a list view adapter for that, need to have 3 item types for one message (start, middle, end) and the types may change when new messages come in, eg. end &ndash;> middle.</p>

<h2>Understand what&rsquo;s behind it</h2>

<p>It is easy to reference other&rsquo;s UI, but it is also important to understand why they handle information that way and even we will not handle like them, make sure we aware of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently started a new project in work so I finally have a chance to use SwipeRefreshLayout. The integration is very simple and does not change the structure of ListView like <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/android-pulltorefresh">Android-PullToRefresh</a> (I still love that library), so it should be easier to perform custom logic on the ListView afterwards.</p>

<p>I also like the progress bar embeded in the view very much, and would like to use it in other components to make my apps&rsquo;s UI consistent. A quick look to the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.java">source code</a> and found that it is implemented in the class <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeProgressBar.java">SwipeProgressBar</a>. It is sad that the class is not public and it seems there is no similar class in the framework and support library.</p>

<p>So, I just copy the code of SwipeProgressBar and BakedBezierInterpolator(required by SwipeProgressBar and also not public) myself and put it in my common lib, then use it in my app.</p>

<p>I understand that there are some kind of design principle of the class/methods visibility, but sometime it is quite frustrating that after going through the framework source code and found that you cannot to extend the class because some properties are private and does not have a public/protected getter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to watching world cup evey night through out the week, I spent most of my time these two weekends sleeping. Even not able to do some serious coding, I tried to clean up my long pending reading list, and I just took a look of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.html">SwipeRefreshLayout</a>.</p>

<p>Saw this class a while ago, just from the name of this class, I expected it to be a ViewGroup that handles the pull gesture of the Android style pull to refresh. I was not very interested in this class because there is no plan to touch the refresh UI in work, but it is always good to know it is in the support library.</p>

<p>What really caught my attention is the canChildScrollUp() method in SwipeRefreshLayout. It used ViewCompat.canScrollVertically and special handled pre-ICS.</p>

<p><a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.java">Source line 348</a></p>

<p>``` java</p>

<p>public boolean canChildScrollUp() {</p>

<pre><code>if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &lt; 14) {
    if (mTarget instanceof AbsListView) {
        final AbsListView absListView = (AbsListView) mTarget;
        return absListView.getChildCount() &gt; 0
                &amp;&amp; (absListView.getFirstVisiblePosition() &gt; 0 || absListView.getChildAt(0)
                        .getTop() &lt; absListView.getPaddingTop());
    } else {
        return mTarget.getScrollY() &gt; 0;
    }
} else {
    return ViewCompat.canScrollVertically(mTarget, -1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>(Well I don&rsquo;t understand why the ViewCompat method cannot(?) handle pre-ICS&hellip; then what&rsquo;s the point of Compat?)</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware there is a canScrollVertically() method in View since ICS, and the ViewCompat also provides some interesting method that could simplify some custom ViewGroup implementation. Should put more time to review what&rsquo;s new in those commonly used classes as I believe there is no need to support pre-ICS soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Got some days off last few weeks (public holiday and AL), spent quite lots of time on watching tech talks. (Another video summary post&hellip;)</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QErcmjPxEtg">Hacker Way: Designing the New Messenger</a></h3>

<p>The first one I watched was about designing Facebook messenger, a little bit slow, but talked about some design iterations and considerations through out the process which is quite interesting.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOyoTUETmSM">Hacker Way: Releasing and Optimizing Mobile Apps for the World</a></h3>

<div class="video-container">

</div>


<p>This one is really interesting. It talked about their Android app shipping schedule and workflow. The talk also included their buck system, heard this from other talks but this is the first time I heard (maybe I missed before) about the share build result over network, which is quite&hellip; crazy amazing.</p>

<p>Similar contents but also worth watching.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Dagger">Dagger: A Fast Dependency Injector for Android and Java</a></h3>

<p>I have been researching the possibility of using dependency injection in current project. I think I will use it eventually, especially Facebook and Square are using it for a while. The biggest problem right now is it may affected every part of the app and I am not comfortable doing that without unit tests&hellip;</p>

<p>I also re-watched these two videos from IO 2013 as I am working on related view performance recently</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZFaec9NpA">Google I/O 2013 &ndash; Android Graphics Performance</a></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the long weekend of Easter holiday, I spent some time on watching tech talks from Facebook. The newly uploaded &ldquo;Building Paper 2014&rdquo; series is really cool. Even I don&rsquo;t do iOS, seeing how they tackle the problems and share their approach is totally enjoyable.</p>

<p>Android and iOS apps may have different platform structures, but when your app goes bigger, most likely you will need another level of abstraction to handle large amount of logic, UI and communication betweens components. And when you want further performance tuning, you may need to go beyond the platform like what Paper team did. At that stage, although you are using different languages, the architecture will be similar across platforms.</p>

<div class="video-container">

</div>


<p>I also like the part about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KrF4bIofeo">contextually aware tutorials</a>, if you have time, you should watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiY1cheLpmI">whole event</a>.</p>

<h2>UI details and A/B test</h2>

<p>Besides new talks, I also watched an old talk from &ldquo;Mobile Developer Day by Facebook + Parse 2013&rdquo;. Not sure why I skipped this talk before, probably because the title is so generic &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2w8z6mI47U">Mobile at Facebook</a>. The part that caught my attention is the A/B testing on their drawer to nav bar changes. It&rsquo;s not about what framework they used, not about how many users they put in the AB test, it&rsquo;s about how you see the numbers.</p>

<p>She mentioned that after changing the drawer to nav bar, the result in internal test is good, navigation experience is improved, users feel the app faster. However, when they shipped to 1% test, they find that users liking and commenting less, because users are kind of distracted by the nav bar notification.</p>

<p>This is very interesting to me. We do not have a very detailed metrics system on mobile (have some, but not detailed), I am sure if we do AB test like that, we will not be able to see the abnormal usage changes. This even put me in a doubt that what if we already did changes like that and we still don&rsquo;t know that?</p>

<p>This is like a regression test, not on code but on usage.</p>
